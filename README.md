Every strict organisation, regardless of class or orientation, is represented by common law, such as the Uniform Civil Code, which handles matters like marriage, divorce, receptions, and property inheritance. Article 44 of the constitution demands that the government go above and beyond to ensure that every Indian citizen relies on a shared set of laws. In a report they issued in 1835, the British government recommended setting up Indian agreements, proof, and misconduct regulations. According to the record, specific Hindu and Muslim laws will not be classified. India's proposed Uniform Civil Code (UCC) has long been contentious. The goal is to create a single set of rules for all residents, regardless of their religious beliefs, for personal issues like marriage, divorce, inheritance, and adoption. However, because of India's variety in religions and cultures, implementing a UCC is difficult. According to Article 44 of the Indian Constitution, "The State shall endeavour to secure for the Citizens a uniform civil code throughout the territory of India." It is essential to the nation's governance. The courts may take cognizance of these state policy ideas even though they are not legally binding in any court. In the form of the Indian Penal Code, criminal law is uniform in India. Additional criminal law acts have occasionally been passed in addition to the code. Everyone is similarly subject to criminal law, regardless of location or religion. However, in civil situations like marriage, divorce, inheritance, succession, etc., individuals are subject to personal laws. Civil laws would become more uniform and commonplace if all classes were subject to the same norms, regardless of race, area, religion, or other characteristics.
